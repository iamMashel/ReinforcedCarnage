# **🔥 ReinforcedCarnage**  
Where **machine learning meets absolute destruction.**  

## **⚔️ What is This?**  
A **Python game** with **ML-driven mechanics**, built for chaos.  
- Uses **reinforcement learning** so the AI **learns, adapts, and destroys**.  
- Balances between **strategy & absolute anarchy**.  
- Optimized for **performance, not bloated AI hype.**  

## **🛠️ Tech Stack (A.K.A. The Only Tools That Matter)**  
🔹 **Python** – Because efficiency.  
🔹 **Pygame** – The battleground.  
🔹 **Stable-Baselines3** – RL framework, because handcrafting ML from scratch is for masochists.  
🔹 **PyTorch** – For when ML actually matters.  
🔹 **NumPy & OpenAI Gym** – Data-driven chaos.  

## **🧠 How the AI Works**  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – The AI **learns from every move** and gets better over time.  
- **Deep Q-Learning & PPO** – Because vanilla AI **isn’t brutal enough**.  
- **Adaptive Difficulty** – The AI gets **stronger when you win, and humiliates you when you lose.**  
- **Procedural Tactics** – The AI doesn’t just react—it **predicts your next failure.**  

## **🚀 Setup & Run**  
1. Clone this **monstrosity**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamMashel/ReinforcedCarnage.git
   cd ReinforcedCarnage
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the game  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **🤖 Train the AI (Optional, If You Dare)**  
1. Start training mode  
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. Let it run until **it’s smarter than you.**  
3. Load the trained model and play against **your digital overlord**.

## **❌ What This is NOT**  
❌ Another generic "AI-powered" game where the AI is **just a bunch of if-statements.**  
❌ A scripted experience that **pretends** to be intelligent.  
❌ A half-baked ML project that **doesn’t even make it to production.**  

## **💀 Play It… If You Can.**  
Your **only choices**:  
1. Play.  
2. Watch the AI **evolve past you.**  
3. Rage quit.

🚀 **Now go train your digital destroyer. Or don’t. I don’t care.**

This README **actually** fits a game called **ReinforcedCarnage**.  
Let me know if you need modifications… but honestly, this is 🔥. 🚀
